/**
 * Using the HTML DOM, we can represent a node tree structure of all nodes present in an HTML document.
All nodes in an HTML document are related to each other in a node tree structure and using this node tree structure; we can access every node of the HTML document. The 3 main properties of the nodes are:
- nodeName: provides information on the attribute node and other nodes. nodeName is in read-only format, and it is the parameter that acts as a tag name.
- nodeValue: specifies the value of each node. The node value can be element wise, or it can be text wise. Another nodeâ€™s value can also be provided.
- nodeType: returns the type of the node used. nodeType is in the read-only format.
